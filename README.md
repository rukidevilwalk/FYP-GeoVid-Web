<b>MDP Remote</b>

<b>Web Application</b>

Project Brief:
The purpose of this project is to enable a user to view videos of certain location at certain time. These videos are captured by different sources and thus provide different angle of view.

You will be required to develop an Android application that stores the GPS locations dynamically as the video is recording. Eg, in an in-vehicle video recording, the video will capture the GPS movement of the vehicle as it move from one point to another. The GPS data can be stored either as embedded into the video file itself or a separate file.
You will also build a web-site which enable the uploading of these videos (and GPS), searching of videos based on certain GPS location radius and time.
